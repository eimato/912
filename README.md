Ways to enhance emotional resonance in variety shows
Choose a theme that resonates with others
Themes that are close to life can easily resonate emotionally with the audience. For example, "The Longing Life" chooses "rural life" as the theme, which showcases the tranquility and purity of rural life that people aspire to, and touches the resonance of a large number of viewers.
Like male group, variety shows focus on presenting men's youth and dreams, friendship and passion, showcasing the deep emotions between brothers and the process of common struggle, which can trigger emotional emotions in the audience.
Real emotional expression
Guests sharing their real experiences and insights can create strong emotional resonance among the audience. In some male themed variety shows, guests sincerely share their experiences, and the program attracts viewers with genuine emotional expressions and continues to resonate emotionally.
The touching moments in the "Happy Comedian" series can make the audience empathize and want to constantly reminisce, which is also a manifestation of emotional resonance.
Creating authentic character images
Presenting real and three-dimensional characters in the program makes it easier for the audience to establish emotional connections with them. For example, in male themed variety shows, the vivid portrayal of characters and genuine emotional communication are welcomed by the audience, and the deep friendship between guests and other genuine character relationships can attract emotional investment from the audience.
Increase audience engagement and interaction
Enhance audience engagement and turn them into co creators of the program. For example, the audience's choice in "You the final say" directly affects the plot trend and game results in the program through real-time voting in the live broadcast room. This interaction can make the audience closely connect with the program and enhance emotional resonance.
Through online and offline interactions, fan meetings, and other activities, 'The Longing Life' has increased the connection between viewers and guests, giving viewers a sense of participation and enhancing emotional resonance.
Focus on deep emotional exploration
Some programs with a strong artistic atmosphere, such as "Masked Singer" and "The Voice of China," deeply explore emotions through moving music performances, allowing the audience to watch them again and again, achieving emotional resonance.
The program not only stays at the level of entertainment, but also delves into the theme of thinking and growth, which can resonate emotionally. For example, "Youth Talks" truly portrays the growth and troubles of teenagers, guiding viewers to reflect on their life choices and thus causing strong resonance.
